    notice that there's no layout specified. That's because the dotnet new MVC template includes a _ViewStart.cshtml file that specifies what all views should start with: the layout file!
    More specifically, the code in _ViewStart.cshtml is run before the code in any view is run. To learn more, check out the MS Docs.
